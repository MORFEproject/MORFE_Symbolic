# MORFE2.0

This repo implements the method and examples from:
* A. de F. Stabile, A. Vizzaccaro, C. TouzÃ©. Normal form analysis of nonlinear oscillator equations with automated arbitrary order expansions (2025)



To use this code:
- download the folder on your PC and unzip it
- open VSCode and go to 'file -> open folder -> MORFE_Symbolic'
- if julia is installed on your PC and julia extensions are installed in VSCode the "MORFE_Symbolic" environement should be automatically activated
- otherwise activate the "MORFE_Symbolic" environment to make sure the correct package versions are used during the computation. This can be done via VSCode's built in terminal by using the command "julia --project=."
- run the desired script in the 'test' folder with the play button in VSCode
